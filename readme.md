Notes:

	Alright, I got the dictionary to trim down substantially so
	the program does not eat up all of your computer's memory.

	However, It still takes a really long time to load our largest
	set of sample data: Trump.csv

Extra:

	I have added a text file to this repository outlining
	the comments that we will use during our presentation
	so we can get the expected responses back from our
	classifier.
	
	Our dataset it very much abnormal which is why we were unable
	to predict the exact number of likes. In addition, Naive Bayes is
	is not very accurate with our data either. It works better with
	small comments.
