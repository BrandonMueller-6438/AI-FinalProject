0,"2]\n 1 point\n 13 days ago\n You know the difference between you and me, you think you're smart I actually am. The entire election I watch the\n corporate media manipulates the narrative of Bernie Sanders in a way that was beneficial to the plutocracy. And that\n fucking coward went the entire primary and let it continue. He talked about Revolution but was too big of a coward to\n name who was in the establishment even one God damn time! And I'm sorry you're such a short-sighted idiot who\n lacks the capacity to actually comprehend something for but the most important thing into fixing this country is\n getting Americans informed. And the fact that the corporate media has been spewing propaganda for Hillary Clinton\n this entire fucking time, I don't think it's the smartest thing to validate that shit by voting her into office. And I'm\n sorry you're such a fucking idiot that you can't comprehend that Hillary Clinton winning the election will bring a huge\n level of passivity to the entire population of America and for 4 more years nothing will get done because she is such a\n piece of shit candidate that we will not take back the Senate. And the truth is economic inequality is out of control,\n climate change is at the Tipping Point NOW, oh yeah Wall Street and the banks are gaining more and more power and\n your solution to that is to elect a Centrist who will get absolutely nothing done but will pacify the populace?! Okay\n retard great strategy. I want Trump to win so I can go kick the living shit out of the Democrats, the corporate media\n and the millionaires and billionaires who Force Hillary Clinton on the population. Along with allowing Trump to set half\n the country on fire so the American population really starts understanding the consequences of elections. I mean I bet\n you are such a fucking idiot that you don't even comprehend that one of the main objectives of the government is to\n put people into a passive position of ignorance, because ignorant people are vastly easier to lead. That's literally been\n the Clintons mo since day fucking one. If we have any hope of changing the government or possibly combating climate\n change to actually save the fucking world, you have to get people out of their apathetic bubble and sadly you need\n extreme examples to do that. Because the real problem isn't with our government it is the fact that our population is\n too docile and stupid to stop it from doing the fucked-up shit that it does.

0,"35\n LTE\n Dr. Jill Stein For President\n Anyone trashing Bernie today needs to wake up and\n respect the masterful chess move he just made\n Q. Why did Bernie endorse Hillary now?\n A. They threatened to completey shut him out of the\n convention if he didn't\n Q. Couldn't he have said screw them and go and fight at\n the convention anyway?\n A. No. Hillary has more delegates, Superdelegates, and\n supporters on the DNC rules committee. They would\n have voted down every one of our platforms, denied\n Bernie the opportunity to speak, and basically shut him\n out of the entire process. All the leverage he has gained\n up to this point would be gone\n Q. So wait, Bernie DIDN'T quit today?\n A. No. He had to say she won the primary, he endorses\n her and will help the party defeat Trump, yadda yadda\n but he DID NOT concede. There is a very big and\n important difference. Had he conceded, all of his\n delegates would go to Hillary and he would no longer be\n an option for nominee\n Q. So Bernie can actually still win??\n A. YES. And if he wasn't still TRYING to win, he would\n have conceded. The ONLY option he had to get to the\n convention with his delegates behind him and have a\n chance to still win was to do what he did today. He is\n not a traitor. He didn't sell us out. He did the only\n possible thing he could have done to keep fighting for\n the nomination\n Q. So how can Bernie still win if he's losing the delegate\n count and he just said he will help Hillary win the\n election?\n A. By far the most important thing to the DNC, even"

0,"ost my wife because of Bernie\n No, never expected a political disagreement would lead to divorce. We'd\n been together 12 years. High school sweethearts. We both campaigned f\n Obama (twice) and had that bright-eyed idealism inherent in 20-somethings\n looking for ""change we could believe in\n But I couldn't do it for Bernie. Maybe growing old also meant growing cold,\n because the cynic in me would not let me support him. How? The guy is a\n fucking washout. Hasn't accomplished anything. All he can do is talk and talk\n and talk about shit but he has no idea how to implement\n That's not the point,"" kept saying\n she ""It's about affecting change\n Change? If a guy like Obama couldn't affect change, how could this guy?\n Fuck that\n At first it wasn't even on the radar that we were seeing a rift. Our\n conversations were still robust, we still had our time. We avoided watching\n news or anything remotely election-related together. But it wasn't enough\n She started campaigning for Bernie here in Colorado, normally a swing state\n but when it comes to primaries, it's anti-establishment all the way. l started\n being surrounded by assholes who thought they knew what was good for me\n and everybody else entirely based on what this schmuck fed them. She\n dragged me to a party with a bunch of these schmucks, and trying to have a\n conversation with them was impossible\n never back down (a personality\n light, l know) and at some point l napped at this bernie bro asshole who\n called me a Republican ""who didn't realize l was one."" Chewed him out\n tormed out of the party\n All downhill since then. She wouldn't talk to me for a few days after because\n embarassed her. We stopped having sex (the last time we did was a few\n weeks before that party). The first primaries/caucuses rolled around, seemed\n ke had a little momentum, and oh my fuck did she run away with it.\n actually secretly unfollowed her on facebook (not unfriended\n just didn't want\n to see her stupid shit anymore). The big primaries came and went, New\n York, etc. and it was obvious she was getting a bit unstable. She jus\n couldn't handle not having her way in an election after a decade of getting\n just that. And I won't lie, l threw out the snark pretty heavy\n When it became obvious he wasn't going to win, she became fanatical\n Refused to believe it. Thought he was the messiah and that the world was\n conspiring against him (and her). I never thought she had mental illness until\n then\n We started having huge, all-out arguments, mostly about why l was\n supporting Hillary. She really thinks Hill is the devil incarnate, and anyone\n who supports her has a moral defect. We dredged irrelevant shit up from the\n past just to hurt each other\n Finally, the breaking point came a few weeks ago\n came home from work\n her car wasn't in the driveway. When I opened the door, the dog didn't greet\n me. She took him. Along with pretty much anything of value that we shared\n don't know how she did it so quickly. She must have arranged the mover\n days in advance and had help from someone. Who knews, maybe that\n bernie bro from the party who was seeing her on the side\n All that was left of her was a note she left on the dining room table. It was in\n her beautiful, flowing handwriting, the kind she used when we wrote notes to\n each other in high school. With my eyes heavy with tears I sat down, and\n started reading. It said\n Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken\n nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nugget\n out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the\n door on her\n m so distressed right now I don't know what to do. didn't\n mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results this\n year. feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is he losing? This\n can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. don't want to believe\n the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in\n l want Bernie to be\n president and fix this broken country. I cannot fucking deal with this right\n now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, l thought he was polling well in\n California?\n This is so fucked"

We can smile and chalk\n it up to irreconcilable differences and go our own way\n Here is our separation agreement:\n --Our two groups can equitably divide up the country by landmass each\n taking a similar portion.

Just as genes propagate\n themselves in the gene pool\n by leaping from body to body via sperms or\n eggs, so memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from\n brain to brain via a process which, in the broad sense, can be called\n imitation\n Richard Dawkins, A Selfish Gene\n What Do You Meme? is an exhibition on ""internet memes' within online\n culture. It celebrates memes as a higher art form. It will show how they\n have moved a long way from websites such as Reddit and 4chan, and how\n they are used as communication across cultures. It will explore memes as\n an artistic practice that relate to people in a socio-political (Bernie and\n Hilary) and creative (Doge) way. It will include female meme collectives,\n colloquial meme sites, meme archives and gold mines. It will illustrate the\n transition from a simple 'internet meme' to memes that have transferred\n from URL into IRL. They will no longer be viewed as poor taste or low\n culture but portrayed as the most democratic art form, similar to folk art\n Fellow meme appreciators have sent in their favourite memes, or created\n their own, with a caption explaining what a meme means to them. The\n female collective\n are creating meme inspired pants for the\n exhibition, whilst Instagram artists\n and\n s have\n made original memes especially for What Do You Meme?\n The exhibition will raise curatorial questions, as to how something as fluid\n as an ""internet meme' will work outside of the internet, will it lose its\n meaning and purpose IRL? Will the memes included in the exhibition\n become dated as the internet flows on, dropping one thing and picking up\n the next? Will memes ever be taken seriously in the art world? However,\n one thing is for certain, What Do You Meme? will create an insight into the\n world of memes, encapsulating the most dank of its kind\n Above all else What Do You Meme? looks to much celebrate memes as a\n many light-hearted, such humorous part of the Internet that cannot go\n ignored"

It is also the\n To be fair\n amount of fraud in this election. And how do I know there has been fraud? Well, I have seen some of it firsthand\n When it was time for my state to vote in its primary, I was excited to be a part of the process. Though I could not yet\n vote, I volunteered my time as a poll watchdog, making sure nothing bad was happening. During most of the voting\n time, nothing seemed out\n of the ordinary. But I stayed late after the polls were closing. That was when I saw a black\n man messing with the consoles. I walked up and asked, ""What are you doing?"" He looked around, saw that nobody\n saying, ""I'm getting paid a lot of money to rig this. But you're a kid so nobody will\n else was there, and leaned in\n believe you anyway."" It was then that I realized just how corrupt this system is\n I'm not sure how I kept my optimism for so long. I guess I just thought even if people didn't believe Bernie, they\n would at least believe the facts. Facts like just how bad income inequality has gotten. Facts like how the American\n people haven't gotten a raise in fifty years. Facts like how the Federal Reserve steals from the poor and gives to the\n rich. And facts like how free trade agreements have led to the collapse\n not growth of a number of developing\n countries\n But despite all of this... today, democracy died. The Establishment lives. And we will all suffer\n Why did this happen? Maybe it was just ignorance. Maybe it was all the women voting with their genitals or because\n t's her turn."" Maybe it was all the African-Americans forgetting their history and who had helped them get their\n rights\n I know you're asking\n but who do you support now?! I don't know. I've seen a glimmer of hope from Jill Stein and\n Gary Johnson. But the truth I would gladly take even\n is, Trump over Clinton. Trump isn't the one under investigation\n Trump isn't the one trying to hide so many secrets. On the contrary, at least Trump is an open book. And frankly\n even if he burns this whole country down, it's probably a faster path to real progressive reform than the kind of\n neoliberal backwards incrementalism pursued by Clinton\n I would say God help us all, but God doesn't exist\n If you want\n to share this, don't hesitate\n You don't even need to credit me.

For\n example the US and UK backed coup in Iran was done because the nationalization of oil threatened corporate profits. This was\n especially blatant in guatemala where Eisenhower's fucking secretary of state was on the board of directors of the United Fruit\n\n California\n H\n 4 points 17 hours ago\n not your pal\n I agree wholeheartedly. For the people that aren't quite there yet\n Bernie likes to talk about FDR. FDR had his New Deal. Same kind of stuff Bernie's platform is about. The New Deal didn't pass just\n because FDR was a nice guy. The anti-capitalist left was a powerful force back then. The communist party and the socialist parties\n were powerful. They organized the biggest union drive this country had ever and has ever seen. Millions and millions of people were\n joining unions. Many of them explicitly anti-capitalist. People were striking, marching and demonstrating every day in every city\n The New Deal was a compromise between the left and the capitalists. The government would tax the shit out of the capitalists to take\n care of the mass of people and the left would stop talking so much about the whole ""revolution"" thing. Half the capitalists agreed\n (Democrats), half didn't (the Kochs and whatnot), but it was enough. At the height of the Great Depression, when the government\n didn't have any money"", we got social security, unemployment insurance, federal jobs programs, a minimum wage, bank regulations\n 90%+ top tax bracket. All that stuff. Because they were scared of something worse. Worse for them, anyway\n So even if you aren't quite there yet with the whole socialism thing, if you want New Deal policies, a strong anti-capitalist force in\n America is very advantageous for you\n Now, I would also argue that New Deal policies aren't enough. We have evidence for that. A lot of what we gained has been lost. The\n capitalists first went after the communist party. Accused them of being anti-American, McCarthy, etc. Then they went after the\n socialists. They're the same thing as the commies, etc. Then they went after the unions. With the left highly diminished, they went to\n town on the banking regulations, welfare, etc. How did they do all these things? Money. You know, the thing that capitalists have. We\n left the very people that kind of got fucked in the New Deal (90% top tax rate), the resources (the ability to accumulate surplus value)\n to eventually undo all of the progress we made. So even if we do all the things that Bernie is talking about, eventually they will be\n undone. Been there, done that. That is why we need to democratize our workplaces. One person, one vote. Remove the capitalist\n class for good. Democratically choose our managers. Hire and fire our bosses, instead of our bosses hiring and firing us.

0,"Secrets\n 1 hr\n ""I'm voting for Donald Trump this election. All my friends were Bernie\n supporters and share all this rhetoric online which, as an Economics major\n I can tell you is incredibly naive and the suggested policies will not lead to\n advancing the US and its poor. On the contrary they would stagnate\n development or even induce the retardation of the economy. One more\n thing: I feel sick and tired of the political correctness on UCLA campus and\n is a virtue of my peers. Everything can be interpreted as racist or\n appropriation which is really annoying because generally speaking there\n isn't a great deal of wrongdoing that is happening in this UCLA\n environment. Sure there could be a couple of cases of local racism but in\n the process of getting into everyones else's faces you make people hate\n you, whoever you are regardless of the brilliance of the agenda you are\n pushing forth; it will be detonated as pestering. Sure, whites are to blame\n for colonizing the world and slavery but most white kids these days, who\n are your peers on UCLA campus, agree that history was terrible but when\n you do alienate them you are harming your cause\n admire Sanders for\n financing his own campaign and the peoples movement that he created.\n only wish Bernie was a liberal on social issues and a conservative on fiscal\n ones.

But political novice like you think\n that you actually have an understanding because of the fact you pay attention once every 2 or 4 years. Yeah keep\n dreaming. Bernie could easily come out and say that having the debate during the fucking NCAA finals limit exposure\n to the American people, and that as a true believer in democracy he feels that the American people should be given\n the best chance to hear the information necessary for them making their democratic decision. And that he doesn't\n know why Hillary Clinton doesn't want to make the time to reach a large national audience to inform them about what\n she wants to do for the county. And why she would purposely choose the date that forces the American people to\n make a choice between watching the final game of the series they've been watching all month, and informing\n themselves on the difference between the Democratic candidates? Yeah, I guess politics shouldn't be commented on\n by people who have no fucking idea what they are talking about.\n permalink source embed save save-RES parent report give gold REPLY"

0,"OPEN THREAD Trump's handling of Fox news has put a bad taste in my mouth (self conservative)\n submitted an hour ago by\n I like Trump guys, I am a big fan.\n I have been a supporter of Donald Trump forthe Presidency from the beginning. I have watched nearly all the rallies\n going all the way back to August.\n It's time to be serious though:\n This fight between FOX News and Trump over the debate has really soured me on Trump.\n It is just not presidential to behave like this. Leaders do not run away and hide like Trump is doing. It just shows\n weakness and cowardice.\n Someone deserving of the office of president needs to step up onto the stage tomorrow and defend himself and prove\n his worthiness\n This looks bad for Trump is all I am saying. It's petulent and childish behavior that is an insult to the process. It's a\n really stupid fight to engage in this close to the acual voting\n The people of Iowa are not going to react well to this. I really think Trump might have stumped himself badly.\n I can not support this and you guys shouldn't either. We need real leadership, we need real vision, and we need\n someone who can make Washington work\n Like I said, I was a Trump supporter up until this week.\n I know most of you only support Trump to act edgy and for the memes but a few of you are unironically supporting him\n and I urge you to rethink this.\n Donald Trump never says anything of substance in his rallies. No policy proposals, no legislative agenda, nothing.\n Zero\n All he does is travel from city to city to talk about himself and build his brand. It's not a real campaign. That had\n become clear this week.\n When have you ever heard Donald Trump make an actual serious policy speech? Think about it.\n Donald Trump's whole campaign is nothing but a media circus, a self-aggrandizement tour, and a way to market his\n next reality TV show. It's nothing more than that.\n Somy guys\n I'm going with Ted Cruz next month after all this bullshit Trump is pulling. At least he is a consistent conservative and\n actually understand how things have to work in Washington, D.C.\n share\n save hide give gold re\n 53 comments\n all 53 comments\n sorted by: top\n save\n formatting help\n THIS SUBREDDITIS FOR CONSERVATIVES TO DISCUSS CONSERVATIVI\n SSUES WITH FELLOW CONSERVATIVES. r/Conservative is strictly moderated.\n Please read and familiar\n subreddit.\n\n Bernie Sanders says Police, Not\n Colleges, Should Handle Rape by\n in politics\n 139 points 15 days ago\n Oh won't anybody think of the poor, poor men?\n I'm a huge Sanders supporter but I can't agree with him on this point.

1,"John, one thought worth considering would be for HRC to offer leadership for a\n better kind of politics by suggesting Democratic candidates agree to not run\n negative ads against each other during the primaries. A modern version of\n Reagan's 11 commandment of Republicans not attacking each other. She would\n get credit with voters for trying, Bernie would almost certainly agree and O'Malley\n doesn't matter at this point and probably won't.\n HRC could then spend money running positive ads about herself, juxtaposed against\n Republicans\n which helps her favorable and trust numbers, draws a nice contrast\n between her and Republicans, and when she has to go negative when Republicans\n do, she has a strong foundation of having campaigned for a higher standard of\n politics which voters want.\n Frankly I thought it was dumb for McCaskill and Gutierrez to be attacking Bernie.\n We are going to need his voters to turn out in November for HRC\n he won't be\n nominated. I am doing the opposite\n repeatedly writing friendly and positive\n pieces about Bernie as an HRC supporter, and when the time is right I will have\n money in the bank with him and his people as a liberal to urge them to come out\n in force to vote for HRC. which is not a given\n and we won't have much margin\n for error in a close election.

We will never influence them to vote for Bernie.

We need to disrupt that thread as much as possible.\n 1) Grab proxies. Their ID system makes it even harder to sockpuppet there than here, ironically. We'll pay for your\n VPN if needed.

Try to use proxies from America (ideally) or from\n Western/Northern European countries so they don't get suspicious from a bunch of Caribbean posters popping up.\n Australia is disregarded automatically as a troll.\n 2) Spamming is not effective normally but most of those idiots will spam for us. If you see a lot of Trump anime\n images, complain about them. They will then fill the thread with as much of those anime images as possible as\n retaliation. Keep complaining until you feel it's enough for then or if the mods step in.\n 3) Praise Cruz or Rubio. That is more effective than Bernie for disrupting the thread. Try to make it seem like it isn't\n sarcastic like most of those ""I'm an X now"" pastas. Try to genuinely praise them, Iknow it's hard.\n Any other options are welcome.
