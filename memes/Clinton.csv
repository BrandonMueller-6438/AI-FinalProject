0,"A lot of people have brought up the fact that they won't vote for\n Trump if he's the eventual nominee. l just want to put\n something in perspective\n Justice Scalia's seat is vacant. Ginsberg is 82 years old\n Kennedy is 79, Breyer is 77, and Thomas is 67. Nowadays, the\n data shows that the average age of a Supreme Court\n retirement or death occurs after 75\n These are 5 vacancies that will likely come up over the next 4-8\n years. The next President will have the power to potentially\n create a 7-2 Supreme Court skewed in their ideology\n Think about that... 7-2. Ifthe next President appoints 5 young\n justices, it will guarantee control of the Supreme Court for an\n entire generation. 7-2 decisions will hold up much more over\n time than 5-4 decisions which are seemed to be lacking in\n mandate\n Hillary has made it clear she will use the Supreme Court to go\n after the 2nd Amendment. She has literally said that the\n Supreme Court was wrong in its Heller decision stating that the\n Court should overturn and remove the individual right to keep\n and bear arms. Period\n Everyone saying that they won't' vote for one candidate or the\n other if they are the GOP nominee, please realize this. If Hillary\n Clinton wins and gets to make these appointments, you likely\n will never see another Conservative victory at the Supreme\n Court level for the rest of your life. Ever"

It has been confirmed that the State Department staff, under Hillary\n Clinton, was told to research new drugs to treat Parkinson's disease\n Just why would a government employee at Hillary's State Department be researching this topic? Wikileaks\n reports, you decide\n We know now that as Secretary of State\n Hillary Clinton dispatched her executive staff in the State Dept. to help\n onduct research on Provigil, a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson's\n Alzheimer's, and Multiple Sclerosis\n Provigil is often used to help such patients stay awake and curb extended bouts of sleep. The drug is also used\n to treat narcolepsy\n In a series of emails spanning from August to Oct. 2011, Clinton asks and receives information from her trusted\n inner circle on the drug Provigil, including the side effects of the pick me upper drug favored by long-haul\n truckers to stay awake for long periods of time\n linton refuses to release her medical records to the public. Last week, True Pundit placed a $1 million reward\n on the release of her full medical history. Clinton is now rumored to be suffering from a plethora of medical\n ailments, including: dementia, post-concussion syndrome, Parkinson's Disease, brain tumor, brain injury\n omplex partial seizures, and many more alleged ailments\n This email is the smoking gun that confirms just what Hillary Clinton is desperately covering up\n https:llmail.google.com/mailcaMUMD/?ui-2&ik 7e05ccd5d7&view-pt&search inbox &thF157b4c14ff69b654&siml 57b4 14ff69 b654\n\n 011/2016\n Gmail Fwd: WikiLeaks released emails that prowe the stern problems Hillary has with her health\n UNCLASSIFIED US Department of State Case No F-2014-20439 Doc No, CO5784708\n Sullivan, Jacob J Sullivanj@state.govs\n From:\n Sent:\n Tuesday, October 25, 2011 929 PM\n To:\n Subject:\n Provigil\n So I was wrong that it was invented by the military, but right about military use of/interest in it. Background on the drug\n below.\n Provigil (Modafinil)\n Provigilis used to treat excessive sleepiness caused by narcolepsy or shift work sleep disorder (sleepiness during\n scheduled waking hours among people who work at night oron rotating shifts). It is also often prescribed to treat\n excessive sleepiness in patients with Parkinson's, Alzheimers, and multiple sclerosis, Additionally, it has also gained a\n following among students, truckers, and others who want to stay awake for extended periods of time.\n o Modafinil was developed by the and French firm Lafon was approved by the FDA to treat narcolepsy in 1998. It is now\n sold under the brand name Provigil by the Pennsylvania drugmaker Cephalon.\n o Modafinil gained attention in the medical community because it\n is the first effective stimulant with no significant\n potential for abuse.\n of medications called wakefulness promoting agents; it works by changing the amounts of\n area of the brain that controls sleep and wakefulness.\n certain natural substances in the\n o The precise way that modafinil works is unknown: it seems to slow the release a GABA, a sleep promoter in the brain.\n It may also affect the histamine system, which is connected to sleep regulation.\n o It can be used for two or three day stretches at a time, with few known side effects and little risk of addiction\n Provigil's impact on the body is different from other pick-me-ups, which tend to be indiscriminate intheir function:\n it confines its activity to the particular neurological processes connected with wakefulness and does not act as a broad\n stimulant. This is probably why it has not gained popularity as a street drug.\n o Amphetamines, on the other hand, promote wakefulness by causing dopamine to flood to the brain. Dopamine is a\n broad hitter\n it sets the heart racing\n makes\n and the user feel high, impacting the entire central nervous system.\n Caffeine affects a different pathway that deals with the neurotransmitter adenosine, and is also a\n broad stimulant.\n e military, for obvious reasons, is interested in the consequences of prolonged sleep deprivation and has tested\n modafinil heavily, particularly on pilots.\n o A study carried out by the Air Force Research Laboratory found that fatigued pilotson modafinil maintained flight\n accuracy within approximately 15-30 percent of baseline levels, whereas performance under the no-treatment condition\n declined by as much a\n 60-100 percent. Here, benefits were most noticeable after 24-32 hours of continuous\n wakefulness. A French study yielded similar results and found that for missions of about 24 hours, modafinil for soldiers\n is preferable to naps.\n o In the U.S. military, modafinil has been approved for use on certain Air Force missions. The French, British, and Indian\n militaries have all expressed interest in modafinil.\n UNCLASSIFIED US Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. CO5784708\n https:llmail.google.com/mail/caMUMD? ui-2&ik-7e05ccd5d7&view-pt&search inbox &th-1 57b4c14ff69b654.\n 2/3"

He's pointing out the\n hypocrisy of protesting apple' while using their products\n And it is valid criticism of Al Gore that he flies in a private jet, and it's valid criticism of David Suzuki that he lives in a mansion with a\n carbon footprint which is probably 100 times bigger than my own. Nobody believes that, because of this, what they say about the\n environment has absolutely zero validity, they're just hypocrites.\n reply\n 1 point\n 3 hours ago\n No it's a fallacy, you're assuming their conclusion is wrong because of their actions. Someone can be using meth and claim it's\n addictive and people shouldn't use it, this does not negate the fact that they are right that it is addictive and people shouldn't use it. Or\n they could be wrong about meth, but they're not wrong because they are a user of the drug, they are wrong on their premise of the\n argument and the conclusion they draw\n You can criticize the messenger, but what the person you replied to is saying is that you can't use that criticism of the messenger to\n discredit their message. Just like how Al Gore flying in a jet does not negate the fact that Global Warming is a very real thing. A person\n who drinks and drives and argues for laws against drinking and driving perhaps is a hypocrite, but this does not negate their argument\n that rules should be in place to safeguard the public from intoxicated individuals. That is what the guy you are replying to is saying\n reply\n\n No it's a falla\n you're assuming their conclusion is wrong because of their actions\n Sorry what? Who exactly is assuming their conclusion is wrong because of their actions? And on what are you basing that claim?\n certainly never suggested anything like what you're implying, and l wouldn't\n Just like how Al Gore flying in a jet does not negate the fact that Global Warming is a very real thing\n Who said it isn't? Al Gore (and David Suzuki) is an amusingly hypocritical piece of shit AND climate change/the environment are\n important considerations. Woah, look at that! called Al Gore a hypocrite regarding his position without discrediting the position itse\n just like nearly every other sane person would do\n Hell the very act of calling someone a hypocrite usually indicates that you AGREE with their conclusion in the first place and are\n annoyed that they don't live up to it. If your conclusion is that Apple is an exploitative and harmful global corporation then STOP\n BUYING APPLE. If see someone on a macbook, with an iphone, criticizing Apple's business practices regarding sweatshop labour l'm\n going to tell them to fuck off, not because I disagree with their viewpoint that Apple is a shit company but actually because l AGREE\n WITH THEM AND WANT THEM TO BOYCOTT APPLE. You nitwi\n sheesh\n And let me guess, you're also one of those people who are going to say that because l called you a nitwit my post is an ""ad hominem\n fallacy"" right? An insult is absolutely not the same thing as an ad hominem and pointing out someone's hypocrisy is never inherently\n fallacious.

You\n guys have no idea the wavelengths this guy and his team operates on. It's like he's a time traveler or\n something.\n Explanation: Trump's team knows nobody\n cares about him liking pussy (As evidence by the Facebook stats)\n He's been known as a playboy behind the scenes since forever and has been on the Howard Stern show for\n fuck's sake, so none of this is a revelation about Trump's character. The guy is a fucking billionaire.\n Billionaires get pussy. What this does is it dilutes the other side's case against him by making Hillary's side\n look like TMZ while Trump's side looks like human rights activists. It's all about contrast. ""Trump likes pussy""\n vs ""Hillary armed ISIS\n Trump called a woman fat"" vs ""Hillary stole $6,000,000,000 dollars\n Trump said a\n woman is PMSing"" vs Hillary had her hand in the destruction of multiple countries, the lynching of multiple\n foreign leaders and is now threatening Iran and Russia.\n Trump called a woman ugly"" vs\n Hillary spread classified information, committed\n perjury and engages in pay to play schemes via the Clinton Foundation.\n Every one of these ""scandals\n just makes Trump look like a regular guy and therefor more relatable. All straight men and lesbians like to grab\n pussy. Nobody pays income taxes if they take a loss. Everyone has insulted someone else. Everyone has commented on the weight of\n someone else. Everyone finds Ivanka hot. Nobody can relate to Hillary. She is so far-removed from anything even remotely resembling normal."

That's literally been\n the Clintons mo since day fucking one.

0,"Do you remember 1987?\n Here's a little bit of history that'l get your attention\n 29 yrs. ago\n and nobody was worried about Muslims!\n Do you remember 1987 when the Senators were giving Ollie\n North such a bad time? This brings it all into perspective\n thought you might be interested in this forgotten bit of\n information\n It was 1987! At a lecture the other day they were playing an old\n news video of Lt. Col. liver North testifying at the Iran-Contra\n hearings during the Reagan Administration. There was Ollie in\n front of God and country getting the third degree, but what he\n said was stunning!\n He was being drilled by a senator, ""did you not recently spend\n close to $60,000 for a home security system?""\n Ollie replied, ""yes Sir, l did""\n The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the audience\n sn't that just a little excessive?\n ""No sir"" continued Ollie\n No, and why not?"" the senator asked\n Because the lives of my family and l were threatened sir\n ""Threatened? By whom?"" the senator questi oned\n ""By a Muslim terrorist sir"", Ollie answer\n ""Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?\n ""His name is Osama bin Laden, sir"", Ollie replied\n At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't\n pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A\n couple of people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator\n\n continued. Why are you so afraid of this man?"", the senator\n asked\n Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that l know of\n Ollie answered, ""and the Muslims are trying to take over\n America and destroy it from the inside out and putting their\n people into our political offices. Note: Today...ALL of Obama's\n appointed department head Czars are Muslims and are in all\n Federal Departments!!!\n And what do you recommend we do about him?"", asked the\n senator.\n Well, sir, if it was up to me\n I would recommend that an\n assassin team be formed to eli minate him and his men from the\n face of the earth.""\n The senator disagreed with this approach, and that was all that\n was shown of the clip. By the way, that senator was Al Gore!\n Also: Terrorist pilot Mohammad Atta blew up a bus in lsrael in\n 1986. The Israelis captured, tried and imprisoned him. As part\n of the Oslo agreement with the Palestinians in 1993, lsrael had\n to agree to release so-called, ""political prisoners"". However, the\n Israelis would not release any with blood on their hands\n The American President at the time, Bill Clinton, and his\n Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, insisted that all\n prisoners be released. Thus Mohammad Atta was freed and\n eventually thanked us by flying an airplane into Tower One of the\n World Trade Center. This was reported by many of the\n American TV networks at the time that the terrorists were first\n identified. It was censored in the US from all, pass this on!\n Do Not Break it is 15 years strong!\n This has not been broken since 9/11/01, please keep it going\n 90% of Obamas immediate administration is muslim, including\n him\n The head of our CIA is a Muslim also"

0,"1 point\n 10 minutes ago\n I wouldn't call myself wealthy, and I was initially pro-Sanders. I'm totally for paying more into the system if we can\n get things like Universal Healthcare. My voting for Hillary is because she's the best and most pragmatic option to me\n in the current pool. Third party votes game-theoretically give support to the candidate you least favor. I also don't\n think either of the third party tickets pass presidential muster (though I do like Weld).\n Perhaps it's because my knowledge expands far more than just American history, but almost every year is\n significant in one way or another\n why should I instantly recognize that shitty year when you didn't even combine\n those there two numbers?\n Yeah, talking about patriotism is the big fat contextual hint there. It must be due to my knowledge base being so\n much less expansive than yours. Makes total sense!\n nk source\n embed save\n save-RES parent edit disable inbox replies delete\n reply\n Perma\n C-1]\n score hidden] just now\n Well yes, my point with the knowledge being that those who have autistic tendencies often just stick to a less\n expansive area of expertise. I'm the opposite in the fact that I know a lot about almost eve\n historical detail that has\n occurred in the last 1000 years, as well as a lot before then. Just by our very short discussion it is obvious that your\n area of expertise is very little and your only concern is voting for the Democratic party\n Sure, perhaps you are young and the only democrat you really remember is Obama. Obama is a rarity in ho\n awesome he was, comparable to some of the best presidents in the entire USA history I can see him becoming\n ranked second or third of all time. But the Democratic party hasn't always had this pure image why I'm sure that\n even you are aware of the sexual impurities that even Bill Clinton brought to the party only a couple of decades ago\n And the point of voting third party is because you like their ideas why do you only care about the candidate? With\n third party your voting for ideas until they can become more serious, because neither Gary Johnson or Jill Stein will\n become President under their current party. You're voting for a third party ticket to be a viable option for the future.\n And it doesn't give support to the candidate you least favour, what are you, simple? I am one of the belief that the\n only vote that is wasted is in a candidate and or party that you do not fully believe in. It gives support to the\n candidate that you most support. Why should anyone who doesn't fully believe in Clinton, Trump or their 'respected\n parties continue voting for the lesser of two evils?

0,"August 4\n liberal: I don't like Hillary Clinton\n Me: yes\n liberal She's not going to carry on Obama's progressive legacy!\n Me: makes facebook status\n status: the absence of strong social institutions forces people to model their\n personalities and values on popular media (cool music videos, chill tv\n shows, awesome movies, etc). If you've ever met someone who is\n completely insufferable, think about the TV tropes they remind you of\n Years ago that person was an insecure eight year old completely\n abandoned by the society\n He is exhausted and frustrated after a long day at school. He feels isolated\n from his peers and schoolwork because he's not capable of following his\n teacher's rigid lesson plan. Each day he is filled with anxiety and dread in\n anticipation of the single half hour the classmates are allotted to socialize.\n Everyone else is so confident and he doesn't seem to fit in\n After School, He is sitting on the couch at home and his parents haven't\n returned home from work. After two hours of watching TV, his parents\n return. They are tired from a day of exploitation, so dinner is brief and the\n conversation is terse. Too poor in time and money, most nights the family is\n content watching TV until bed. The child might do his homework while\n watching TV or he might skip it, who cares guarantee he's not going to\n understand the content so yeah (Modern Family is on and its loud)\n\n He's thinking about tomorrow's recess and brushes with the realization that\n he's socially retarded (clinically). He thinks he ought to act like someone on\n the TV\n abusive and controlling villain\n stubborn and infallible hero\n cool, dgaf cool guy\n Then he goes to school and tries out the character. Because he is literally\n surrounded by children, his strategy works pretty well. He eventually\n completes his mandatory and supplementary education. He then gets a job\n and raises kids (yells at them for doing normal kid stuff like making a mess,\n doing drugs, having sex upstairs). This whole time he is convinced that he\n is the embodiment of shallow Hollywood story morals. His ideas of right\n and wrong, heroic and villainous, etc are determined by capitalists trying to\n sell merchandise at Walmart.\n Then he hits on you at the bar and you (enlightened) think ""WTF who says\n that? this guy can't be real"", but the is.\n So I think that everyone is confusing the memorable movie characters with\n Obama and Clinton's meticulously crafted brands. This is the constitution of\n their political ideology\n If that child had a large and heterogeneous group of friends (ages\n especially), if that child had a family (he had a family but they were too\n bogged down by wage slavery), or some other outlet for socializing, the\n child might have obtained the skills and experiences necessary to be a\n fulfilled individual.\n\n Not trying to family values"" ""strong family values"" and ""its the poor moms\n fault"" here, but Contemporary economic conditions (our contemporary\n lifestyles ie anything not in bands of 80 humans hanging out all the time) is\n going to retard our growth in a lot of ways. (socially, intellectually,\n physically, emotionally, spiritually, etc).\n these people are going to be very dumb people and they will think ""obama\n is cool TV character guy"" and then vote for him. (And yes I believe some of\n the dislike for Hillary Clinton is driven by ingrained misogyny, like lol how\n can you not think this? Think about how many\n ""berniecrats"" (cringe) think\n Obama is a cool dude and did a lot for this country, but Hillary is the\n pinnacle of 'establishment politics"" (they mean neoliberalism, they dont\n have the vocabulary).\n Share\n 1 share\n 8 Comments\n lol you think too much man like chill out BRO, itjust our\n Society\n 3 August 4 at 9:08pm\n Wow this is really fucking good\n 2 August 4 at 9:14pm\n I feel this so hard.\n 2 August 4 at 9:46pm\n I meant to add ""neighborhoods"" next to family\n and school as\n examples of defunct social institutions\n August 4 at 11:41pm\n replied 1 Reply\n\n ur g-ing too many an be cool dude\n 1-August 4 at 11:52pm\n this post made imdb's top 250\n 2 August 5 at 12:33am\n I feel like I was raised by video games. Progression systems\n with clear goals. Put the circle peg in the circle hole and get a guaranteed\n reward\n 2 August 5 at 3:15am\n thats a neat way to romanticize a dopamine drip\n (i like video\n games but they are problematic)\n 1 August 5 at 6:38am"

Constitution\n requires a two-thirds vote in both the U. S.\n House and Senate. Afterwards, two-thirds\n of the State's Legislatures and Governors\n must ratify the repeal or amendment to\n the Constitution for it to take place.\n So, even IF a president wanted to abolish the\n second amendment and grab all the guns, he\n or she would have to get the consent of over\n two-thirds of Congress and the States.\n This talk that President Obama or Secretary\n Clinton would do that is a baseless fear tactic\n designed to enrage the less educated among\n you and fill you with fear for something that\n could never happen.\n In short, you're being conned\n\n No your being conned.. it takes time and alotof false flags..we aren't\n saying they are or she will definitely pull it off..but people sure know they\n trying..and as long as they even trying thr will be major probs alot more than\n recent it's not the actual taking the 2nd amendment you should be concerned\n with its what they are going to do to get congress to agree or try\n Like Reply\n 14 hrs\n Jeremiah Watson She us NOT TO BE TRUSTED.

Yet so many of the Children of the Eerft Reddit simply seem\n incapable of getting the most basic things.\n For example; you seem to simply be fundamentally unable to comprehend the connection of illegals and even legal\n immigration to the very things you lament, whether they were part of Sanders' platform o\n or the Clinton platform of\n lies she is feeding you. You don't get that illegals undermine black communities in particular. you don't get that\n illegals undermine minimum and low wages. You don't get that illegals and legal immigration undermines the effort to\n fix education because, why, you can just import talent from India, et al., for less while illegals simply overload the\n system. You don't get that Mexico is actively trying to load the southwest up with hispanics in order to take it back for\n Mexico once hispanics are citizens and can vote in hispanic politicians with loyalties to hispanics and Mexico and further\n fracture society and our country. President Vicente Fox is on record, in his voice\n in context, openly saying that the\n Reconquista of the southwest is going on and exactly as I laid it out above.

0,"3 hrs\n So my two cents on the whole plagiarism thing. Can you really copy write\n something that everybody in the entire world has said at some point? If you\n can that is stupid beyond reason. Secondly, where was all the media when\n Obama did the very same thing several times in his career? In fact, he said\n stuff that mothers and fathers normally never talk about. So why wasn't he\n accused of anything? The answer is that the media doesn't care and\n neither should we. Speeches aren't copy written like books are. Speeches\n can also influence a person subconsciously in a way that books don't. The\n conclusion that every logical person should conclude is what is the media\n trying to hide from the uneducated? The answer is Rudy Giuliani and his\n blasting of Obama and Clinton and Mrs trumps overall good speech that\n would have taken away a whole lot of women voters. think the conclusion\n is quite obvious.\n Like Comment\n a Share\n The value of the cent must be lower than Ithought.\n Like Reply 2 hrs"

0,"23 hrs\n I've taken a long time to internalize and contemplate not just the current\n social disorder, but more so its root causation\n I have previously directed\n my attention to the substandard Education System within America that is\n strife with inequalities. It is here where the true problems lie\n for it is\n through this institution of education where the bulk of opportunity for\n aspiring Americans is born. Education is not just about developing the\n individual or making one smarter, but facilitating and promoting the\n OPPORTUNITY for success.\n America was and is built upon the principle of equal opportunity, yet the\n illusion of that principle has caused a sharp schism within America, one\n that is finally being fully exposed, or rather finally being fully considered in\n the public eye.\n When avenues and access to opportunity become more equalized, I\n believe it will be the first step toward creating a more harmonious and\n prosperous society, one that will not only transcend cultural and stigmatic\n differences, but one that will usher in a new age of American Excellence.\n When America reestablishes the claim that, ""if you work hard enough, you\n be successful"" to apply to all Americans of all upbringings, America and\n everyone in it will be empowered\n\n So your saying that hard work can't get you out of every\n situation?\n Like Reply 10 hrs\n ith no disraspect\n ould claim on the\n contrary.

If you don't stop posting, you can expect several things your private information\n becoming public, life changes and eventually death in the hands of Allah\n port block\n ply ful\n re: Just a little warning\n Listen up you shillbot, how much is Hillary paying you to send this message? A hundred dollars? Well, guess what... I\n can't double that because I don't have rich Saudi corrupt donors. If Shillary's game is to send death threats to people\n who debunk her articles and meme about how shit she is\n I'm not even surprised. If you're going to send me such\n threats atleast use an account older than a month. Your account is not even 10 minutes old!\n Anyway since you made some harsh accusations in your message\n I'll do what I always do- debunk them\n Here goes:\n The Content you post on several subreddits, mainly the donald, is racist, homophobic, islamophobic and misogynistic\n ets take it bit by bit. Racist? Where? Is it those dilemma shitposts I used to post? Well, muslim is a religion\n mm\n and illegal isn't a race. Plus, I've hardly spoken about Mexico when you come to think of it. Maybe like 5 posts about it\n at max. Next comes Islamophobia:\n The defintion of a phobia: an irrational fear\n Thus, by defintion, by being 'islamophobic' I rrationally f\n Islam. However, this is not the case out here\n I fear Islam\n but with a rationale cause- They're anti-lgbt, they're pro-rape, they're pro murder, they're pro sexual slavery, they're\n fine with child marriage and they're pro domestic violence. How is this an 'irrational fear. And as for homophobic\n what?\n I love faggots, especially our dangerous\n faggot Milo. And a muslim talking about homophobia? You messed\n that one up, didn't you? And misogynistic? The closest thing I could find was debunking Hillary's article on the\n ""Woman card'. Debunking myths doesn't make me a misogynist. You Islamic shits are the true misogynists.\n I My first order is for you to stop posting in the donald\n Nope darlin\n not happening\n As a muslim Clinton supporter, l find your content very offensive\n Facts don't care about your feelings.\n I you don't stop posting, you can expect several things your private information becoming public, life changes and\n eventually death in the hands of Allah\n so the first one was a doxx threat. Well screw you\n he second one was\n Puberty? The third ones a death\n threat.

It's for all these reasons that you know I'm not just bluffing when I say that Bernie Sanders was our last\n chance\n this cannot entirely be blamed just on ignorant citizens who didn't stop to learn about Bernie. It is also the\n To be fair\n amount of fraud in this election. And how do I know there has been fraud? Well, I have seen some of it firsthand\n When it was time for my state to vote in its primary, I was excited to be a part of the process. Though I could not yet\n vote, I volunteered my time as a poll watchdog, making sure nothing bad was happening. During most of the voting\n time, nothing seemed out\n of the ordinary. But I stayed late after the polls were closing. That was when I saw a black\n man messing with the consoles. I walked up and asked, ""What are you doing?"" He looked around, saw that nobody\n saying, ""I'm getting paid a lot of money to rig this. But you're a kid so nobody will\n else was there, and leaned in\n believe you anyway."" It was then that I realized just how corrupt this system is\n I'm not sure how I kept my optimism for so long. I guess I just thought even if people didn't believe Bernie, they\n would at least believe the facts. Facts like just how bad income inequality has gotten. Facts like how the American\n people haven't gotten a raise in fifty years. Facts like how the Federal Reserve steals from the poor and gives to the\n rich. And facts like how free trade agreements have led to the collapse\n not growth of a number of developing\n countries\n But despite all of this... today, democracy died. The Establishment lives. And we will all suffer\n Why did this happen? Maybe it was just ignorance. Maybe it was all the women voting with their genitals or because\n t's her turn."" Maybe it was all the African-Americans forgetting their history and who had helped them get their\n rights\n I know you're asking\n but who do you support now?! I don't know. I've seen a glimmer of hope from Jill Stein and\n Gary Johnson. But the truth I would gladly take even\n is, Trump over Clinton. Trump isn't the one under investigation\n Trump isn't the one trying to hide so many secrets. On the contrary, at least Trump is an open book. And frankly\n even if he burns this whole country down, it's probably a faster path to real progressive reform than the kind of\n neoliberal backwards incrementalism pursued by Clinton\n I would say God help us all, but God doesn't exist\n If you want\n to share this, don't hesitate\n You don't even need to credit me.

0,"Here's the thing though...say by some miracle Johnson\n actually gets in. He's a lame duck and will be stymied by both democrats and\n republicans because he broke the monopoly, same as if Sanders got in.\n Nothing he wants to do will be passed, which is really\n the best case scenario\n for this election considering the other options.\n Now say one of the two Conspirators gets in, which is obviously the likely\n outcome.

This was\n especially blatant in guatemala where Eisenhower's fucking secretary of state was on the board of directors of the United Fruit\n\n California\n H\n 4 points 17 hours ago\n not your pal\n I agree wholeheartedly. For the people that aren't quite there yet\n Bernie likes to talk about FDR. FDR had his New Deal. Same kind of stuff Bernie's platform is about. The New Deal didn't pass just\n because FDR was a nice guy. The anti-capitalist left was a powerful force back then. The communist party and the socialist parties\n were powerful. They organized the biggest union drive this country had ever and has ever seen. Millions and millions of people were\n joining unions. Many of them explicitly anti-capitalist. People were striking, marching and demonstrating every day in every city\n The New Deal was a compromise between the left and the capitalists. The government would tax the shit out of the capitalists to take\n care of the mass of people and the left would stop talking so much about the whole ""revolution"" thing. Half the capitalists agreed\n (Democrats), half didn't (the Kochs and whatnot), but it was enough. At the height of the Great Depression, when the government\n didn't have any money"", we got social security, unemployment insurance, federal jobs programs, a minimum wage, bank regulations\n 90%+ top tax bracket. All that stuff. Because they were scared of something worse. Worse for them, anyway\n So even if you aren't quite there yet with the whole socialism thing, if you want New Deal policies, a strong anti-capitalist force in\n America is very advantageous for you\n Now, I would also argue that New Deal policies aren't enough. We have evidence for that. A lot of what we gained has been lost. The\n capitalists first went after the communist party. Accused them of being anti-American, McCarthy, etc. Then they went after the\n socialists. They're the same thing as the commies, etc. Then they went after the unions. With the left highly diminished, they went to\n town on the banking regulations, welfare, etc. How did they do all these things? Money. You know, the thing that capitalists have. We\n left the very people that kind of got fucked in the New Deal (90% top tax rate), the resources (the ability to accumulate surplus value)\n to eventually undo all of the progress we made. So even if we do all the things that Bernie is talking about, eventually they will be\n undone. Been there, done that. That is why we need to democratize our workplaces. One person, one vote. Remove the capitalist\n class for good. Democratically choose our managers. Hire and fire our bosses, instead of our bosses hiring and firing us.

I could just\n\n approach women in public, but I've decided not to take the risk\n when the writing is carried along by my sadness. The knowledge\n of being in the most progressive state in America means\n Washington is the eye of the Storm of the impending paradigm\n shift\n Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Donald Trump have talked\n about how the corporate hostile takeover of the political process\n has corrupted the system. However, while Hillary Clinton has\n talked about the economic bias towards the wealthy within the\n Current political millieu, she has Still decided to take money from\n these corrupt monetary sources, while Bernie Sanders and Donald\n Trump have decided to take matters into their own hands\n Donald Trump has decided to pay for his own campaign himself\n while Bernie Sanders has decided to ask individual donors for no\n more than $2700 each. Bernie Sanders edged out everyone, so for\n Washingtonians, people matter more than profits\n do indeed have an EBT card. At least I won't starve thanks to JP\n Morgan Chase profiting from giving 4 on Americans free\n money they have to put forth towards bolstering the grocery\n economy in order to live.

All the homeless shelters around\n here are run by Christians. However, homeless shelters depend\n upon cash donations and require cash contributions in order to\n keep their doors open. Most of the monetary funds come from the\n largest charitable organization in Washington\n The charitable organization that Contributes the most money to\n Washington state homeless shelters is The Bill and Melinda Gates\n Foundation. Bill and Melinda Gates are atheists. The only guilt\n have is the weight on my heart of mass ignorance. Liberal chicks\n are hot. So, yes. m a 36 year old liberal atheist man with an EBT\n card, honey. Liberals fight for progress and change\n Afterward: They flock to their own kind like racists flock to the\n Republican party.

0,"13 hrs\n Trump will protect the nation of lsrael and rip away from the thoughts of\n man the outlandish ""right"" to express oneself as one wishes by lawful\n means, and for this, my friends, choose him over Hillary Clinton. Trump\n is not going to be a dictator as so many allegedly say, rather he will be the\n man who wipes out extremist threats and l hope brings peace to God's\n chosen nation Israel. Certainly, their are concerns for these candidates,\n both morally and theologically, I would like to say that to let Clinton into\n office is to loose whatever one has left of moral sanity. Arguably, Clinton\n will usher our country into deeper depravity than we have already plunged\n ourselves into, and for her to be president is to loose all we have left as a\n country morally and theologically. (Last political statement until elections)\n I'm ambivalent towards many of Trumps comments, yet for him to stand\n by God's holy nation lsrael, speaks volumes about that man, it speaks\n volumes about any man.\n Whether it's Trump or Clinton, God is still God, and He will continue to\n reign on His holy throne for all time.

Was it bad that the leftist\n American fighters in the Spanish Civil War were the 'Abraham Lincoln Brigade'? Is it bad that in\n Venezuela the revolution uses the image of Simon Bolivar? Is it bad that Hillary Clinton has a\n strong support base of black people because of the image they have of Bill Clinton whereas the\n republican base has abandoned Jeb Bush's attempt to use the legacy of George Bush? ls it\n bad that people think Kurt Cobain is a genius whereas the countless bands that mimic him are\n inferior All of these are forms of a ""cult of personality' once we remove the mysticism and\n propagandistic function of the words.

Today l may seem like a crazy\n conspiracy theorist but in time you and everyone is going to see and\n realize this has all been happening our whole lives right in front of our\n eyes. Since I have researched American History outside the American\n School system\n it is scary how much of what we were all taught in school\n wasn't quite as host or really happened. It is true the winners of wars\n right history. An example, we have all seen the pictures of how starved\n the Jews were during the holocaust. And they were, but what we were\n not shown were the pictures of the German soldiers who were also\n starving at the end ofthe war. We were nottold about the hundreds of\n thousands of male Germans we put in chain link open prisons with no\n food or protection from the elements and thousand upon thousands of\n German POW's were essentially murdered in captivity. Now moat\n people would say that they had that coming. But killing war prisoners is\n illegal today as it should be. Again, do not believe me necessarily but\n research the things I am saying. The evidence is out there and much is\n available in government records but most dont know what they are even\n supposed to be looking for. you don't see the pictures that have\n German guards just as skinny and starving as their jew captors you soul\n never know to look for it.

Nowadays, the\n data shows that the average age of a Supreme Court\n retirement or death occurs after 75.\n These are 5 vacancies that will likely come up over the next 4-8\n years. The next President will have the power to potentially\n create a 7-2 Supreme Court skewed in their ideology\n Think about that... 7-2. If the next President appoints 5 young\n justices, it will guarantee control of the Supreme Court for an\n entire generation. 7-2 decisions will hold up much more over\n time than 5-4 decisions which are seemed to be lacking in\n mandate\n Hillary has made it clear she will use the Supreme Court to go\n after the 2nd Amendment. She has literally said that the\n Supreme Court was wrong in its Heller decision stating that the\n Court should overturn and remove the individual right to keep\n and bear arms. Period.\n Everyone saying that they won't' vote for one candidate or the\n other if they are the GOP nominee, please realize this. If Hillary\n Clinton wins and gets to make these appointments, you likely\n will never see another Conservative victory at the Supreme\n Court level for the rest of your life. Ever."

Immigrants don't pay taxes. Round them up and kick\n them out. Trump doesn't pay taxes. He's a business genius. Hillary's foundation only spent 87%\n of their donations helping people. She's a crook. Trumps foundation paid off his debts, bought\n sculptures of him, and made political donations to avoid investigations while using less than 5%\n of funds for charity (and he got shut down by NY State). So savvy... Put him in the white house.\n Trump made 4 billion dollars in 40 years, when an index fund started at the same time with the\n same ""small loans"" he received would be worth $12 billion today... without a trail of\n bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits and burned small business owners. He's a real business\n whiz. Hillary took a loss of $700k. She's a criminal. Trump is the first candidate in the modern\n era not to release his tax returns, and took a billion dollar loss in 1 year. Genius. Hillary takes\n responsibility for private email servers and apologizes. Not credible. Trump denies saying things\n (on the record) he actually said (on the record), he's just telling it like it is.\n Your arguments are thin. Your ignorance of reality is shocking. Your double-standards are\n offensive, and your willingness to blindly support him and recycle the rhetoric is absurd. Your\n opinion is not fact. Your memes are not news articles. And your hypocrisy is not a platform.""\n Alex Schiller"

3,"From: bieglobalculturalstrategies.com\n To: john podesta gmail.com\n Date: 2016-03-13 17:06\n Subject: From Bill Ivey\n Dear John\n Well, we all thought the big problem for our US democracy was Citizens\n United Koch Brothers big money in politics. Silly us\n turns out that money\n isn't all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the\n electoral process. Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats\n and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas,\n free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and w\n re off and\n running. JFK, Jr would be delighted by all this as his ""George"" magazine saw\n celebrity politics coming. The magazine struggled as it was ahead of its\n time but now looks prescient. George, of course, played the development\n pretty lightly, basically for charm and gossip, like People, but what we are\n dealing with now is dead serious. How does this get handled in the general?\n Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer\n and not a celebrity in the Trump,\n Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I'm certain the\n poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the\n conventions are over, but I think not. And as I've mentioned, we've all\n been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire\n to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains\n strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands\n some serious\n serious thinking\n and not just poll driven,\n demographically-inspired messaging."

At the same time, Tony\n Podesta is also a top campaign contributor and bundler for Hillary\n Clinton.

6,"Anti-Fascist News posted about AltRight.\n Anti-Fascist News\n 13 hrs Politic\n There are a lot of really bad profiles o\n the Alt Right that are coming out\n in the days after Hilary Clinton's speech. We need to say unequivocally\n that these people simply don't get it. No, the Alt Right is not just\n provocative Edgelords. No, they are not just Twitter trolls (though that is\n part of it). No, they are not the fringes of the GOP\n What the Alt Right is is the new name for a confederation of fascist\n ideas, whose central tenants are racial nationalism, inequality, elitism,\n anti-democracy, and an essentialist view of gender and social\n stratification. They would not even deny this description. They have\n been around for years at this point, and have a long history with other\n White nationalist and fascist organizations and philosophers. S\n this is\n not just a new trendy phenomenon, but really just the latest stage in a\n neo-fascist movement that has had continuity since the Second World\n War. They resurrect the same myths about black inferiority, Jewish\n power, and feminist subversion that they always have, and just\n because now they use parenthesis around names and attack black\n comediennes doesn't mean that they are just a new brand of angry\n young men (though that is probably true too.)\n The fact that news outlets cannot seem to get a handle on this owes to\n the fact that the reality of white nationalist organizing has never been\n taken seriously, and now we are paying the consequences for it.\n This should also come as a huge shout out of thanks and gratitude to\n Antifa and anti-fascist organizers who have been confronting the Alt\n Right in the streets from the start. #altright #antifa\n 5 Comments 43 Shares"

6,"A lot of people have brought up the fact that they won't vote for\n Trump if he's the eventual nominee. I just want to put\n something in perspective.\n Justice Scalia's seat is vacant. Ginsberg is 82 years old,\n Kennedy is 79, Breyer is 77, and Thomas is 67. Nowadays, the\n data shows that the average age of a Supreme Court\n retirement or death occurs after 75.\n These are 5 vacancies that will likely come up over the next 4-8\n years. The next President will have the power to potentially\n create a 7-2 Supreme Court skewed in their ideology\n Think about that... 7-2. If the next President appoints 5 young\n justices, it will guarantee control of the Supreme Court for an\n entire generation. 7-2 decisions will hold up much more over\n time than 5-4 decisions which are seemed to be lacking in\n mandate\n Hillary has made it clear she will use the Supreme Court to go\n after the 2nd Amendment. She has literally said that the\n Supreme Court was wrong in its Heller decision stating that the\n Court should overturn and remove the individual right to keep\n and bear arms. Period.\n Everyone saying that they won't' vote for one candidate or the\n other if they are the GOP nominee, please realize this. If Hillary\n Clinton wins and gets to make these appointments, you likely\n will never see another Conservative victory at the Supreme\n Court level for the rest of your life. Ever."

You don't give a shit about anyone in the Middle East other than a\n political hammer for your own tainted agenda\n Holy shit, dude, I'm a second generation Syrian Kurd immigrant in the US. My parents immigrated to the US just\n before I was born. I have family members still living in Syria or in refugee camps in the Middle East. I've had family\n members killed by your military in ""accidental"" drone strokes. A cousin of mine\n was a physician working in a hospital\n that was bombed by the Americans. He\n was killed, and many of his patients, innocent civilians, were killed as we\n Neither Obama nor Clinton have a problem with this, and continue to deny or minimize allegations of wrongdoing on\n the part of the US military. I'd rather put a bullet through my skull then vote for the woman who has helped engineer\n the deaths of my family and countless other innocent lives\n There are 500,000 people dead in the civil war, and 11 million displaced. What's your brilliant plan to save them?\n Maybe your evil government should realize that bombing the shit out of a country has never once in the history of the\n orld brought about democracy or peace. All US involvement in the ME has done is create instability and death. If you\n actually gave a shit about Syria, you wouldn't be supporting the re\n who have ties to Da esh, al-Nusra, al-Qaeda,\n and other salafists. The Kurds are the only side in this conflict that actually care about securing a better future for the\n people of Syria, but your government betrayed them because the\n refused to stand down and turn over power in\n Rojava to a western-selected capitalist government\n We wouldn't want a successful socialist state to exist in our midst!\n No, it's better to arm the ""moderate"" rebels who want to install an Islamic theocracy after they drive out Assad\n on displaced\n 11 mi\n And you think continuing to bomb the country is helping? If the US actually cared about human rights or refugees\n then they wouldn't support brutal regimes like the KSA. Saudi Arabia regularly executes queer people, women, and\n apostates, and is currently committing crimes against humanity in Yemen, but I don'\n see Hillary Clinton calling for\n King Salman's head. Face it, your country only human when profit to be xpropriating another country's resources. Syria sits on top of of the largest natural gas reserves in the world and\n has refused to let western business interests access to it. Your government supports the rebels because they're wi\n ng\n to play ball. It's the same reason Hillary Clinton and Obama don't give a shit about the right-wing Honduran\n government sending death squads after environmental activists and other political enemi\n it's good for business to\n look the other way.\n I'm not even addressing the rest of your bullshit because you're seriously such a garbage person. You and the rest of\n the Democratic Party only care about marginalized people when it's fashionable. None of you cared about us before the\n election, and soon as your white queen gets into office, you\n stop pretending like you actually give a shit about drone\n strikes or refugees or other oppressed people. Your democracy is a complete farce; no matter who I vote\n for, assuming\n I vote for either major party candidate, I'm voting for more death, more destruction, and more war in my homeland\n No matter who wins, the military-industrial complex wi\n umber on, killing PoC in the name of profit.

10,"Robert Higgs\n Yesterday at 2:43 PM\n In the USA, millions of men and women have been\n fined or imprisoned even though they have harmed no\n one. Every day cops arrest thousands without just\n cause and treat hundreds of thousands abusively and\n with total contempt for their rights and personal\n dignity. Moreover, hundreds of millions live\n or would\n live, if they had a clue in fear of the police\n Yet, Bill and Hillary Clinton have never spent a single\n night under lock and key, nor have they paid a single\n dollar of restitution to any of their countless victims.\n This difference illustrates what is truly meant when it\n is said that the U.S. criminal justice system works. It\n works, all right, to shield the rich and the politically\n powerful and connected from responsibility for their\n crimes while implementing a police state for the little\n people. Nothing to see here, amigos. Just move along.\n Think about these things the next time you see that\n shit-eating arrogant look on Hillary's face as she\n gazes out at the world with ill-concealed disdain and a\n burning desire to smash her opponents and a great\n variety of others under her coercive heel. She knows\n full well that she will never be held to account for her\n crimes and that she can proceed to pile a mountain of\n new ones atop the old ones as soon as she takes\n office as president."

The implication is that\n President Obama does not care to acknowledge police officers who have given\n their lives in the line of duty. This is a fallacy. No president wants to see any\n police officer harmed or killed. Period. Iam old enough to have voted for\n Reagan when he ran for his second term and here are some interesting facts\n about police officers killed in the line of duty during that time\n Reagan Presidency-1507 total deaths, 1312 at his seventh year\n Bush (Sr) Presidency -707 total deaths\n Clinton Presidency 1147 total deaths, 1309 at his seventh year\n Bush (W) Presidency 1133 total deaths, 985 at his seventh year. This number\n does not include the 72 officers killed on 9/1\n Obama Presidency-890 total deaths at this point, 803 athis seventh year\n During those 34 years and 5 presidents, Wis the only one I can recall having a\n press conference honoring fallen police officers. And that was on 9/11.Imust\n have missed the other 4544 press conferences held by President Obama's\n predecessors honoring those fallen heroes\n I understand that a lot of people don't like President Obama. But please do not\n vilify him for behaving the same way every president has in our lifetime. He has\n done what each of his predecessors has done: condemned the actions. Look at\n the numbers. Instead ofdamning him for an incorrectly perceived slight, we\n should be praising him for having the fewest number of slain police officers in\n generations\n These numbers are from the National Law EnforcementOfficers Memorial\n Fund website"

What's your brilliant plan to save them?\n Maybe your evil government should realize that bombing the shit out of a country has never once in the history of the\n orld brought about democracy or peace. All US involvement in the ME has done is create instability and death. If you\n actually gave a shit about Syria, you wouldn't be supporting the re\n who have ties to Da esh, al-Nusra, al-Qaeda,\n and other salafists.

JFK, Jr would be delighted by all this as his ""George\n magazine saw\n celebrity politics coming. The magazine struggled as it was ahead of its\n time but now looks prescient. George, of course, played the development\n pretty lightly, basically for charm and gossip, like People, but what we are\n dealing with now is dead serious. How does this get handled in the general\n Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer\n and not a celebrity in the Trump,\n Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I'm certain the\n poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the\n conventions are over, but I think not. And as I've mentioned, we've all\n been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in\n general conspire\n to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains\n strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands\n some serious, serious thinking and not just poll driven,\n demographically-inspired messaging."

The rise of terrorist threats that have inspired violence\n here at home, and we've seen an erosion of law and order in our streets.\n And we've seen opportunities and jobs evaporate and even leave Ohio and\n leave this country. I would say to any of our kids that if Donald Trump and I\n have the chance to serve in the white house that we're going to work every\n day for a stronger, safer and more prosperous America."""

28,"Racist trolls of 8chan are driving traffic to\n Donald Trump's website\n By Noah Kulwin\n August 31, 2016 l 11:00 am\n For the last few months, Donald Trump's campaign has spent a lot of time distancing him\n from the white supremacist groups that seem to have embraced his message.\n The GOP nominee has found himself in this position as some of his noisier supporters\n online circulate racist memes on his behalf and congregate on websites and message\n boards known for their open racism, in particular 8chan, one of the internet's most\n notorious hate hubs.\n Visitors to 8chan also happen to frequent\n donaldtrump.com, according to\n referral data\n from analytics firm SimilarWeb. 8chan is one of the top 10 referrers to Trump's campaign\n site, according to the service, providing a small but growing percentage of its traffic.\n 8chan is an image-focused message board that was created in late 2013 by a former\n contributor to another message board, 4chan, who felt that 4chan which itself is known\n for racism, misogyny, bomb threats and more\n was too tame. 8chan came to prominence\n during the\n Gamergate controversy in 2014 and was identified as an organizing spot for\n people online (largely men) who liked to share racist memes and what the tech blog\n Gizmodo called the nastiest shit on the internet\n Although most people will likely never encounter 8chan directly (in part because Google\n does not link to the site in search results for ""8chan""), the board has left its mark on the\n 2016 campaign trail. When Trump caught flak earlier this summer for tweeting an anti-\n Semitic meme about Hillary Clinton, Mic.com discovered that the image was created by\n 8chan users."

Nowadays, the\n data shows that the average age of a Supreme Court\n retirement or death occurs after 75.\n These are 5 vacancies that will likely come up over the next 4-8\n years. The next President will have the power to potentially\n create a 7-2 Supreme Court skewed in their ideology.\n Think about that... 7-2. If the next President appoints 5 young\n justices, it will guarantee control of the Supreme Court for an\n entire generation. 7-2 decisions will hold up much more over\n time than 5-4 decisions which are seemed to be lacking in\n mandate.\n Hillary has made it clear she will use the Supreme Court to go\n after the 2nd Amendment. She has literally said that the\n Supreme Court was wrong in its Heller decision stating that the\n Court should overturn and remove the individual right to keep\n and bear arms. Period.\n Everyone saying that they won't' vote for one candidate or the\n other if they are the GOP nominee, please realize this. If Hillary\n Clinton wins and gets to make these appointments, you likely\n will never see another Conservative victory at the Supreme\n Court level for the rest of your life. Ever."

Studying and diagnosing her every move and tactic. And she fell\n right into his trap like the pawn she is.\n This is not an average man you're dealing with here. Make no mistake, this is a genius beyond your wildest nightmares. He\n was toying with her like a cat with a mouse, while she was fighting for her life. She has nothing left.\n Now that he has a full mental blueprint of his enemy there is nothing that can stop him. Expect something out of this world\n in the next 2 debates. Something unprecedented in all of modern politics.\n Mark my words, the lion has been let out of the cage, and he's hungry tonight. So go now, retreat to your twitter and your\n reddit accounts.

73,"COMEY'S LETTER CORRECTED\n Dear Messrs Chairmen:\n In previous congressional testimony, Ireferred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of\n Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton's personal email\n server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony even\n though this is against department policy and l have been strongly advised by the Department\n of Justice not to do so.\n In connection with an unrelated case concerning Anthony Weiner's sexts to an underage girl,\n the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that\n appear to be I have no idea whether or not\n are pertinent to the investigation because no one has read them. The FBI has not, in fact, even\n secured legal authority to read them yet. Iam writing to inform you (even though it violates\n department protocol) that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed\n that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps\n like actually securing a warrant\n designed to allow investigators to review these emails, many or all of which could be duplicates\n of emails we've already reviewed, to determine whether they contain classified information, as\n well as to assess their importance to our investigation, which could be nil.\n Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant because we\n have not read them, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional\n work although it certainly won't be complete before Election Day allowing people to\n speculate about the contents of emails even the FBI has not yet read and could just be\n duplicates l believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my\n previous testimony, which was also unprecedented and in violation of protocol.\n Sincerely yours,\n James B.

The allegation is that he would ""corner women\n make them\n uncomfortable and make suggestions about having sex.""\n The source encouraged me to contact women who worked under him in the\n Nevada office.\n I was wondering if you were able to describe your experience with Marshall\n and if any of this rings true, with you or anyone else you know who worked\n there.\n The source also claims that Robby Mook was made aware of the issue, but\n declined to act on it or intervene because he is personal friends with\n Marshall. Do you know if there is any truth to this?"

Today we are entering some\n uncharted waters with global political instability and a barely-contained shadow-recession\n domestically. We have always reliedon partners in government and that is as true today as\n it ever has been. Both our own internal research and Mrs. Clinton's strategic intelligence\n have identified emergent threats on the near-horizon\n Today Mrs. Clinton willdiscuss the possibility of domestic chaos inthe coming national\n election.

Suddenly, there\n was a loud clang as a fellow hair-boy came running into the alley with a\n flashlight, just as Hillary reached for my belt buckle. was saved just in\n the nick of time, she scurried away but please share this terrible story\n with others, do not become a victim of Hillary"

Do tell...\n The fact that we're considering the spouse of someone who was impeached for president is beyond me\n Well first off, being impeached for lying about a bee is a pretty lightweight offense and pretty much a political play to\n try to discredit him (see: Benghazi today) more than actually do anything useful in government.

I have no idea if this applies to the Clintons but it very well could\n if you're married to a guy who cheats on you, it's not considered an ideal marriage.\n No, although sometimes cheating can make otherwise great relationships stronger or more stable particularly when\n one party is on a very different page, sexually, for example. Because I don't know what happened in their marriage,\n how it was affected positively or negatively, or anything, I hesitate to speculate as to if their marriage is awesome or\n terrible\n I mean, if you think perjury and obstruction of justice are lightweight offenses for the leader of a nation, sure\n Given the context, it was. I don't care what his personal business is and I was pissed off that this nation spent tens of\n millions of tax dollars to investigate him up and down and only came up with basically that within the investigation, he\n lied.

Nowadays, the\n data shows that the average age of a Supreme Court\n retirement or death occurs after 75.\n These are 5 vacancies that will likely come up over the next 4-8\n years. The next President will have the power to potentially\n create a 7-2 Supreme Court skewed in their ideology.\n Think about that... 7-2. If the next President appoints 5 young\n justices, it will guarantee control of the Supreme Court for an\n entire generation. 7-2 decisions will hold up much more over\n time than 5-4 decisions which are seemed to be lacking in\n mandate\n Hillary has made it clear she will use the Supreme Court to go\n after the 2nd Amendment. She has literally said that the\n Supreme Court was wrong in its Heller decision stating that the\n Court should overturn and remove the individual right to keep\n and bear arms. Period.\n Everyone saying that they won't vote for one candidate or the\n other if they are the GOP nominee, please realize this. If Hillary\n Clinton wins and gets to make these appointments, you likely\n will never see another Conservative victory at the Supreme\n Court level for the rest of your life. Ever."
